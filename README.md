#Using Github
While the Git GUI program on PKI computers is a little more difficult to use I would advise using the official GitHub Desktop located: https://desktop.github.com/

**Our Repo URL is:** https://github.com/lericah/ISQA4110m2.git

When using the Desktop::: ![alt text](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7475977/19581720/bda434fa-96f4-11e6-828f-83680798b2c8.png)
**1.** follow the intro instructions to login using your github account

**2.** add our project by clicking the plus sign in the top left corner 

**3.** Clone the repo using this URL and sync your changes to make sure your local copy of the repo is up to daye

**4.** make changes to your branch(ie. Matt, Douglas, Brevan, Master) by selecting the branch on the top and left of center

**5.** when done commit the changes to your branch by entering a summary and if necessary a description and hit "Commit to XYZ"

**6.** now that you have commited a change hit Sync in the top left corner to sync your changes.

Make sure to also check the Issues list on github by left clicking on the relavent repo and clicking "view in Github"

##Some Terminology

**Branch** - a split in the repository which is like a temporary fork. Matt will manage the master branch by taking changes in the individual branches and merging them into a master. This way we can all work simultaneously and also maintain our own versions of all the files.

**Clone** - This copies repo on Github and makes a local copy for you to work with. You may also work from Github personally though this is more suited for quick edits of text documents and not quick edits of word documents

**Commit** - this is a pre-change point where you decide to make a change. Nothing is changed in the git log for the repository until you make a commit.

**push/sync** - this pushes your changes to the branch of your choice. By default files you delete will be reflected in the Git Desktop but basically a push takes all of your git changes and modifies the repo/branch based on the commited changes.
